Behind an author, there are always many people involved to make a book possible. This is especially true for this 3rd edition, as five long years have passed since the 2nd edition. I am grateful for the feedback, help and encouragement provided by the following individuals. The book is a living document, so it will get regular updates over time. As IT professionals change title and companies, let’s stick with just name and photo.

A lot of engineers from Armenia, home of vRealize Operations and Log Insight, have made the product better and hence the book possible. The book cover photo is Jermuk. Too many folks to mention so allow me to list partially: Hakob Arakelyan, Felix Azizyan, Tigran Mkrtchyan, Anna Grigoryan, Anahit Serobyan, Artur Aghabekyan, Gagik Manukyan, Vahan Tadevosyan, Tigran Avagimyants, Tigran Matevosyan, Robert Mesropyan, and Arman Mkrtchyan.

A product does not exist without UX magic touch. Kim Ramirez, Nareg Kirkian, Lusine Dashtoyan, Varun Gajjar, Abhishek Chouksey are my treasured partners.
If you value the deep technical information on the counters, then send your thank you to Valentin Bondzio, Richard Xunjia Lu, and Ming Hua Zhou. They have contributed source code level knowledge, which was crucial as the book goes deeper than what’s available publicly. 

The VMware TAM community has been a great partner, giving me the opportunity to engage with many of our largest customers and get real world validation. Paul James, Tas Tareq, Sajag Chaturvedi, Jodi Shely, Julian Foo, Claud Antao, Jesús Velasco, Luciano Gomes, Lerpong Intaraworrapath and the METNA team under Shiv Diddee leadership.

The 3rd edition is also made possible because of my role. Having a global role and being a part of product team enabled the development of the book. Folks like Mike Sumner, Kamau Wanguhu, Susan Aoki, Monica Sharma, Chandra Prathuri, Kameswaran Subramanian helped me in this life changing career move.
