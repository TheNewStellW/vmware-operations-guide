### Chapter 4
# Configuration Dashboards

The configuration dashboards aims to implement the concept covered in Configuration Management chapter. 

Each operation is like a fingerprint. While there are commonalities, each customer runs their operations a little differently. Hence it’s not possible to design one dashboard that meet every customer’s operational needs. A configuration that is important for one may not even be relevant for another. We encourage you to tailor this dashboard to your unique environment. If needed, widgets can be collapsed or expanded allowing more relevant data to be displayed.
