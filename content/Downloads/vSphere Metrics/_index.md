Happy to announce the 3rd edition to start the year of 2024!

vSphere ships with many metrics and properties. If we take object by object, and document metrics by metrics, it will be both dry and theoretical. You will be disappointed as it does not explain how your real world problems are solved. Youâ€™re not in the business of collecting metric.
This document begins with you; experienced VMware professionals tasked with optimizing and troubleshooting production environment. It documents the metric following the Triple See Method, a technique that maps metrics into operations management.

This is advanced-level book. At 300+ pages, it is not a light reading. So grab a cup of coffee or your favourite drink and enjoy a quiet read. 

The book is far from completing its mission. The vSphere Cluster chapter and Microsoft Windows chapter are partially finished. Iâ€™ve included them as they are still useful to you, and itâ€™s useful for me to get your feedback. Beyond vSphere, vSAN metrics and NSX metrics are not yet added. Beyond metrics, we have events, logs, and properties.
The reason why I open source the book is it is a call for collaboration to the VCDX, VCIX and all VMware professionals. 
By now you get the hint that this book is not a product book. It does not cover how to use vSphere Client performance tab, esxtop, and Aria Operations. There are better documentations on that alreadyðŸ˜‰
