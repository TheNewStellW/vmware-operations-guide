# VMware Operations Management
### Journey Towards Proactive Operations, powered by vRealize

#### 3rd Edition, Update 2, June 2021

Five long years have passed since the [2nd edition](http://virtual-red-dot.info/released-vmware-performance-and-capacity-management/) of the book and you will find that this 3rd edition has been written from the ground up, with many new and expanded sections, as well as the removal of many parts that are now considered level 100. There are now 4 parts of the book. Part 3 has been brought forward to Part 2, as you need to know the metrics before using the dashboards. Also, compared to 5 years ago, creating your own dashboard is easier. Part 4 has been added for miscellaneous stuff that may expand in the future.

The book remains a Day 2 book. It's not a Day 1 book covering product installation and configuration. This is intentional, to cater for customers not running the latest version. Some parts of the book can be vRealized with earlier versions of vRealize Cloud Universal, while other parts require you to build super metrics.

The book complements the [official manual](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/index.html). I can't change the overall structure of our manual, as it's part of a VMware wide standard. The manual focuses on Day 1, while this book focuses on Day 2, after you've got VMware vRealize Suite up and running.

Operations are like fingerprints. Two companies can have identical architecture, yet their operations will not be the same. Their processes will differ, and the people have different preferences, hence this book supports the idea that you tailor the product to your unique operations. Now you know why it comes in an editable format. Keep the good parts, throw away the bad ones, add your unique contents, and voila you have documented your operations! Post a screenshot of a cool customization you've done and you'll make my day.

The ability to customize vRealize to your operations has been the hall mark of the product since it was released more than a decade ago. I was a pre-sales engineer when I first saw 1.0 many blue moons ago. The ability to slice and dice an environment was a godsend, as I spent a lot of time helping my customers troubleshooting and optimizing their environment. This 3rd edition continues the tradition of the book by showcasing what you can vrealize, not simply what's out of the box. Until today, I see vRealize as a platform, not just a product.

This book ***is the documentation*** of Operationalize Your World, a 2-day workshop that [Kenon Owens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenon-owens/) and I created many years ago. Thank you Kenon for the leadership in the early days!
