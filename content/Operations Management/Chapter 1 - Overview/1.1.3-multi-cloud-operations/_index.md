Don't be disheartened if your organisation is struggling with running a multi-cloud operations. A single private cloud, something you have complete control, is hard enough to operate, let alone operating multiple incompatible infrastructure. The complexity is due to the lack of maturity of the architecture. There are simply too many components involved, as shown in the [landscape diagram](https://landscape.cncf.io/) by Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Eventually though, the architecture will slowly mature and turn into a commodity. CIOs will begin focus on the operations as business will demand proper governance with SLA.

Regardless of the underlying system architecture, CIOs are still required to manage cost, capacity, compliance, performance and availability. The Pillars of Operations do not change just because you change the plumbing. We will cover more of these pillars [here](/operations-management/chapter-1-overview/1.1.8-pillar-vs-process/).
