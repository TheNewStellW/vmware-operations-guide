### Chapter 3
# SDDC vs. IaaS

What you architected is SDDC, but what you operate is IaaS. You buy system, you sell service. 

This chapter provides an introduction to how IaaS management differ to the physical infrastructure management. It is placed at the end as this is now considered a basic knowledge. I still find it useful in explaining why the complexity goes up significantly. IDC actually predicts this back in 2012. The [link](http://www.apmdigest.com/idc-prediction-predictive-analytics-goes-mainstream-in-2012) from APM Digest website states that "operational complexity in virtualized, scale-out, and cloud environments and composite Web-based applications will drive demand" for a new type of tools that can "rapidly sort through hundreds of thousands of monitor variables, alerts and events".
