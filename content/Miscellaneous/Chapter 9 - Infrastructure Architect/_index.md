### Chapter 9

# Infrastructure Architect

I see myself as an Infrastructure Architect. After almost a decade in application world, I entered the weird and wonderful world of enterprise IT infrastructure, starting as a presales with Sun Microsystems in 2003. My job titles, roles and departments have changed many times since then, but fundamentally it's about architecting enterprise infrastructure. My official role is a Product Manager for an operations management product, but I still see myself as the engineer doing the performance troubleshooting and reading logs.
