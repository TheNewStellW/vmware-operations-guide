Wow, you made it to the end of the book. If you have read this far I certainly want to know more about you. So here is a bit about me.

I was born in the beautiful island of [Lombok](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/lombok)(Indonesia), grew up in Surabaya (Indonesia), studied in Australia, and since 1994 I live in Singapore.

I graduated from [Bond University](https://bond.edu.au/) in 1994, then migrated to Singapore and started working in IT. I still remember that I carried [Apple Mac LC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC) (yup, with the 12" monitor) to Singapore in June 1994.

First 9 years of my career was at the Application layer, doing business process innovation and application development. Lettuce Node, I mean Lotus Notus, was and is still dear to my heart.

I moved to infrastructure world in 2003, focusing on UNIX by joining Sun Microsystems. I joined without knowing what UNIX was and basically zero knowledge of infrastructure. I came to join as SE with no presales experience. My previous manager Seet Pheng Kue recommended me, together with the headhunter FA Mok, and Kim Boo Png made the hiring decision. I'm always grateful for what they have done as that forever changed my career. From high level programming to low level hard code infrastructure!

In 2008 I applied to VMware as I wanted to follow my sales Chan Seng Chye. Poh Wah Lee convinced me to join VMware as part his team, and until today I still see him as my elder and leader.

My email is e1@vmware.com and mobile is +65.9119.9226.

You can see more of my works on the Internet. Google has somehow tracks it

## Operationalize Your World

The transformation toward multi-cloud operations is a journey. The same journey happened that resulted in this book on your screen. It took years for it to reach the level of maturity.
