### Chapter 7

# VMware IT Operations

We partner with VMware IT as our Customer. That means we treat them as real customers as they run our products in real production environment. Ravishankar Rao and George Stephen represent the Tools solution and I've asked them to share their journey in evaluating and customizing vRealize to their operations. Their goal is for the experience to be useful for other customers, so I've asked them to write as if they are external customer so you can take the relevant bits in your own evaluation and customization.
