The first part of the book explains the art of Operations Management in the context of VMware cloud architecture. It is a pre-requisite to Part 2.

What you architect is [SDDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_data_center). But what you handover as a business result to your CIO is [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service). One is a system, the other is a service. We can assess if the architecture is good or not, based on the actual result in production. Does it result in firefighting and blamestorming? Or do you have a peaceful operation where alerts are meaningful and actionable?
